# Cultiv_T_RP2
Codes and circuits for "Efficient Magic State Cultivation on RP^2"

## Installation
Check the [installation_guide.md](https://github.com/Zihan-Chen-PhMA/Cultiv_T_RP2/blob/main/installation_guide.md) for how to install a customized version of PyMatching 
for calculating soft outouts and how the sinter package is slightly modified to support reading csv files with large fields.

## To plot
Run the mega_plots.py file

## To run some sampling
(Before running anything, make sure to clear the [sample_results](https://github.com/Zihan-Chen-PhMA/Cultiv_T_RP2/tree/main/sample_results) folder.)
- MSC-3 cultivation process alone: d3_T_cult_sampling.py
- MSC-5 cultivation process alone: d5_T_cult_sampling.py
- MSC-3 end-to-end: d3_end2end_sampling_2d.py
- MSC-5 end-to-end: d5_end2end_sampling_2d.py
